# Instagram-uploader
As the name suggests, this is a simple bot written in ```NodeJs``` to automate the upload of a post on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/).

## Installation
Clone the repo: <br>
```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/sl1mSha4dey/instagram-uploader.git 
```

Navigate to the repo folder and install the packages:
```
$ npm i 
```
Once you've installed the packages, all you need to do is to configure you ```.env``` file that you will need to run the program. 
You can also not use the .env file, however you will need to replace all the ```process.env.CONSTANT``` occurences with the associated data.

## Configuring the ```.env``` file
Create a file named ```.env``` into the repo folder and set it up like this:
<div>
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58223071/194145957-8105a177-7daf-4576-8e74-97b62a026ebc.png" alt=".env-configuration-pic" />
</div>


## Usage
Once you've installed the packages and set up the .env file all you need to do is run the following command:
```
$ node index.js
```
